# Python-Data-Sci
**The exercises in this repository were designed and developed by [Eric Lohmar](https://github.com/EEdLoh).**

Per the designer of this course, Eric Lohmar, this set of exercises serves to "[Explore] the world of the Python Programming language with the intent to gain an understanding of Data Science and Machine Learning processes and skills."

# Running the Files
The first 5 exercises focus on learning the basics of Python - data types, string methods, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and objects.
* 01: Python Data Types and Collections
* 02: Strings and String Methods in Python
* 03: Control Flow in Python
* 04: Functions in Python
* 05: Classes and Objects in Python

To run the exercises above, simply download the file and run in the following command line prompt. 
```bash
python "[file name]"
```
Using VS Code, you can also run the Jupyter cells in the Python Interactive Window. Be sure to install Jupyter using the following command line prompt.
```bash
pip install jupyter
```
